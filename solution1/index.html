		TAJ MAHAL
		<p>Agra, commonly referred to as ‘Taj City’, is the country’s most prized city, recognisable by the iconic Taj Mahal – an ivory-white mausoleum built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz. This UNESCO World Heritage Site (and a symbol of love, too) is reason enough to visit Agra.Standing majestically on the banks of River Yamuna, the Taj Mahal is synonymous to love and romance. The name "Taj Mahal" was derived from the name of Shah Jahan's wife, Mumtaz Mahal, and means "Crown Palace". The purity of the white marble, the exquisite ornamentation, precious gemstones used and its picturesque location, all make a visit to the Taj Mahal gain a place amongst the most sought-after tours in the world</p>

		BANARAS GHAT
		<p>Nestled on the banks of the sacred Ganges river, Varanasi is one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities. For centuries, culture, religion, history, art and education have thrived here, and that’s exactly what makes it one of the most visited cities in the country.People from across the world come here to attain nirvana and seek blessings of the Lord. Attending a Ganga aarti (Hindu ritual of worship) is an experience for a lifetime! .Visitors can just sit at one of many ghats and observe people from different walks of life; or take a boat ride along the shore for a stunning view of the ghats (flights of steps leading to the river). For moments of peace and spiritual experience, there is no better place than the City of Gods.</p>

		LAND of NAWABS
		<p>The capital of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow is a beautiful historical city that hardly merits a mention in many travel guides. Whether you’re a history buff, culture vulture, wildlife explorer or a food connoisseur, there’s something for everyone in the Land of Nawabs. Awaiting you are the Mughal ruins dating back to 17th and 18th centuries, such as Bara Imambara, Chotta Imambara and Rumi Darwaza; the early 19th-century Dilkusha Kothi built in English baroque architecture, the bustling Hazratganj, and the many cultural and natural places. Not to be missed is its rich Awadhi cuisine – you must definitely try the kebabs (tunday, seekh and galouti) and lucknowi biryani (a combination of rice, spices and marinated chicken)</p>
